At a high level it provides the following major components: 

- Limit orderbook completeness with order-level specificity (Not only price and volume but actual order queues).
- Stochastic process generators for rich/complex simulations (Brownian, Hawkes, etc).
- Agentic functionality for Singular and Distributed Learning. 
- OnChain Model Deployment: Currently supporting the Solana Virtual Machine.
