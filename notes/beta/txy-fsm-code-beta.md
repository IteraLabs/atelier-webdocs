# txy ↔ fsm ↔ code — Master Reconciliation Tracker (v0.1-beta-2)

> **Status rollup:** **7 / 24 done** · **1 doing** (#9 — Phase 1 of 6 landed) · 0 blocked · **1 spec✓** (#3 — code half pending) · 15 todo — _updated 2026-06-16_. Bump this line whenever a row's **Status** changes.

**Purpose.** The single, priority-ranked action list to close the gap between the **Taxonomy** (`txy/txy-beta.md`), the **FSM Atlas** (`fsm/*-beta.md`), and the **codebase**. Each row is a discrete, independently-shippable unit of work, tracked live via the **Status** and **Owner** columns.

**Indexed in** [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md) as the third leg (reconciliation ↔ code) beside `fsm/` and `txy/`.

**Evidence base.** Derived from `../../v0.1-integration.md` (repo root) — a live deployment (control plane built from source, SEQ-1 Deploy + SEQ-2 Delete driven end-to-end) plus a 50-agent static audit (10 FSMs scoped to owners per §2.4.1, 9 repos × Taxonomy C1–C7, 5 integration aspects). **All 26 load-bearing findings were adversarially verified (0 refuted).**

**How priority is ranked.** Descending by *(leverage × value) ÷ cost*, respecting dependencies and risk:
1. **Make the yardstick true first** — where the code is intentionally ahead, fix the spec (cheapest, removes phantom gaps).
2. **Unblockers next** — actions that other actions depend on (e.g. Channel wiring → recovery + Sink).
3. **Observable correctness** — gaps a user sees in the webapp or a process gets wrong.
4. **Wire cut + the big rename last** — coordinated, multi-repo, highest churn.

### Legend

- **Group / Wave** — `0·Config` (W0 quick wins) · `1·Spec` (W1 spec-first, doc-only) · `2·Wire` (W2 coordinated wire cut) · `3·FSM` (W3 code) · `4·Rename` (W3 cross-repo rename).
- **Status** — `Todo` · `Doing` · `Blocked` · `Done` · `Spec✓` (spec edited, awaiting code) — update in place as work progresses.
- **Owner** — defaults to the **lead repo/area** where the change starts; reassign to a person/team as you delegate. (Full ripple is in *Blast radius*.)
- **Complexity** — `S` ≤ ½ day · `M` 1–3 days · `L` ~1 week · `XL` multi-week / coordinated.
- **Blast radius** — `Contained` (1 repo, no wire) · `Moderate` (cross-file, 1 migration/config, or some re-verify) · `Wide` (multi-repo, wire-breaking, or needs live re-verification). Flags: `[wire]` consumers regen · `[runtime]` re-verify on a live stack · `[ops]` operational/topic/group · `[observer]` webapp-visible.

```

**Two anchors.** **#9 (Channel wiring)** is the highest-leverage single action — pure caller-wiring on an already-complete DB layer — and it unblocks #13 (IR-O5), #14 (Sink), and SEQ-4/5 recovery. **#24 (Worker rename)** is the largest and riskiest; defer to last and land it in one cut with #23, because `WorkerId` doubles as the wire `task_id`.

## Fix-spec vs fix-code (where the gap actually is)

- **Fix the spec, not the code (W1, ~25% of items by count, ~5% by effort):** #1, #2, #4 — and the *spec half* of #3. The code is intentionally ahead; updating `atelier-webdocs` is the cheapest way to shrink the gap and stop chasing phantom findings.
- **Fix the code (W0/W3):** #5–#20 — wire up dead code, implement missing transitions, correct observable behavior.
- **Two-sided cut (W2/W3):** #21–#24 — wire contract + coordinated cross-repo renames; spec and code move together in one tagged version cut.

## What is NOT a gap (verified)

The control-plane core is sound and **ahead of the prior 109-item backlog**: drain-to-completion (O-T6/O-T7/O-T8), the `INV-SV8` skill-mismatch orphan, A-T8/A-T9/A-T10/A-T18, E7 live skill validation, and the Session TTL lifecycle (SN-T3/T4/T5/T7) are all implemented. Schema (96%), proto (92%), wiring (82%) and the five-repo carve-out are clean — no FSM logic leaked into any non-owner repo. `atelier-overplex` (98%) and `atelier-lakehouse` (93%) are essentially compliant.

## Implementation-plan candidates (assessment)

Not every row warrants an expanded plan. A row is a **strong candidate** when it scores high on all four:

| Criterion | Question |
|---|---|
| **Leverage** | Does completing it unblock other rows? |
| **Boundedness** | Is the work concrete enough to enumerate steps now? |
| **Known detail** | Do we already have file:line anchors and a clear DoD? |
| **Risk** | Is it risky enough that a sequenced plan de-risks it? |

Scoring the high-priority rows:

| # | Leverage | Boundedness | Known detail | Risk | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#9 Channel wiring** | **High** (unblocks #13,#14,SEQ-4/5) | **High** (DB layer complete — pure caller-wiring) | **High** (primitives, schema, gate sites all located) | Med (new runtime gates) | **★ Plan it (below)** |
| #10 restart_epoch | Med (INV-CH5/GW1 lineage) | Med (re-init loop is new design) | Med | High (cross-FSM) | Runner-up |
| #11 ManifestAck reject | Med (enables #15) | Med (needs SDK + overseer co-design) | Med | Med | Runner-up |
| #24 Worker rename | High (taxonomy) | Low (383 hits; needs a rename script + wire cut) | Med | High | Plan only **after** scope decisions (#2,#3) |
| #1–#8 | n/a | Trivially bounded | High | Low | Self-evident — no plan needed |

**Pick: #9.** It is the only row that is simultaneously high-leverage, fully bounded (the persistence layer already exists and is correct — this is wiring, not design), and rich in known anchors. Planning it also de-risks the new B-T3/T-T3 gates by sequencing observation before enforcement. #10 and #11 are the natural next plans once #9 lands (ask to expand them).

---

## Implementation plan — #9: Wire the durable Channel FSM

> **One-line:** the durable Channel lifecycle is correct, complete **dead code with zero callers** — wire the existing primitives into the Gateway handshake, the deploy gates, recovery, and drain. *No new persistence design; no migration.*

### Definition of Done (spec invariants that must go green)

- Every connected Binding has durable `channels` rows that reach `open`: CommandChannel + ManifestChannel(embedded) + TelemetryChannel + one ArtifactChannel per declared Sink (CH-T1 → CH-T2). **Live check:** `SELECT count(*) FROM channels WHERE binding_id=…` > 0 (today: **0**).
- **INV-CH1** (Open ⇒ handshake complete), **INV-CH2** (channel_id unique), **INV-CH6** (ManifestChannel embedded, exactly-once idempotency key) assert at their boundaries.
- **IR-CHO1** (B-T3 requires CommandChannel + TelemetryChannel Open) and **IR-CHO3** (T-T3 requires declared ArtifactChannels Open) enforced as guards.
- **IR-CHO4** (SEQ-4 recovery re-probes channels per reconciled Binding; dead transport → CH-T10 `failed` → B-T7 force-release).
- **SEQ-5 drain** walks Open → Draining → Closed (CH-T3 / CH-T4).
- Handshake timers wired → `CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILED` (61) on expiry.
- `channels.restart_epoch` written (=0 at open); the non-zero increment on A-T8 lands with **#10** (INV-CH5).

### What already exists (do not rebuild)

- **Schema (complete):** `atelier-lakehouse/overseer-db/migrations/20260604000001_i5_channels.sql` — 7 status values, `reliability_class` enum, `restart_epoch`/`sequence_high`, status↔timestamp CHECK, `channels_idempotency_key_uniq`, `channels_live_idx`, `channels_draining_idx`.
- **Primitives (zero callers):** `atelier-overseer/atelier-overseer/src/db/queries/channels.rs` — `create_channel`, `mark_channel_open`, `mark_channel_draining`, `mark_channel_closed`, `mark_channel_failed`, `list_live_channels_for_binding`, `list_draining_channels`. Model at `db/models.rs:293`.

### Reliability-class mapping (pass at `create_channel`, per `channel-beta.md §2.10.3`)

| Category | reliability_class | Note |
|---|---|---|
| command | `at_least_once_ack` | bidi CommandChannel |
| manifest | `exactly_once_idempotency` | embedded in CommandChannel; reserve `idempotency_key` (INV-CH6) |
| telemetry | `best_effort_sequence` | |
| data | `at_least_once_sequence_gap` | |
| artifact | `sink_class` | inherits the Sink's class — **couples to #14** |

### Seam decision (per §2.4.1)

The `channels` row is **overseer-persisted** (the gateway is stateless). So the Gateway should **signal** open/close via a `lifecycle.events` event and the overseer's `gateway_consumer` calls `create_channel`/`mark_channel_open` — exactly mirroring how `AgentRegistered` lands the `agents` row today. Do **not** have the gateway write Postgres directly.

### Phased steps

**Phase 1 — Open durable rows on connect (CH-T1 → CH-T2), observation only.**
1. In `atelier-gateway/src/channels/command.rs` (CommandChannel accept, ~`:49–52`/`:107`), after JWT auth + binding resolution, emit a `ChannelOpening`→`ChannelOpen` lifecycle signal for category `command`; overseer `gateway_consumer` calls `create_channel(...'opening')` then `mark_channel_open`. Emit the `ChannelOpen` Event (INV-P3).
2. Same for the embedded **ManifestChannel** (category `manifest`, reserve `idempotency_key` from the manifest).
3. Same for **TelemetryChannel** on the second stream.
4. **ArtifactChannel(s)** — one per declared Sink (category `artifact`, class `sink_class`), opened when the agent opens the artifact stream (SEQ-1 step 27).
   *Land Phase 1 first and verify rows appear with no behavior change — see Verification.*

**Phase 2 — Enforce the channel gates (IR-CHO1, IR-CHO3).**
5. Add a B-T3 guard: CommandChannel + TelemetryChannel rows are `open` for the binding before B-T3 fires (today it fires off A-T2 with no precondition — `seq1_deploy.rs:435–436`).
6. Add a T-T3 guard: all declared ArtifactChannels are `open` (atomic with the T-T3 persist).

**Phase 3 — Recovery re-probe (IR-CHO4 / SEQ-4 Stage 1).**
7. In `reconcile_on_boot` (overseer `services/overseer/mod.rs:960–1184`), for each reconciled Binding call `list_live_channels_for_binding`; dead transport → `mark_channel_failed` (CH-T10) + B-T7 force-release. *(Also satisfies #13's channel half.)*

**Phase 4 — Drain (SEQ-5 / CH-T3, CH-T4).**
8. In `start_drain`/`finish_drain`, for `draining` RemoteAgent bindings call `mark_channel_draining` (CH-T3); on settle `mark_channel_closed` (CH-T4). The gateway SIGTERM closure couples to **#20**.

**Phase 5 — Handshake timers.**
9. Add `gateway.handshake_timeout_ms` / `channel.open_budget_ms` (default 2000) to `atelier-gateway/src/config.rs:8–23`; bound the currently-unbounded Registration/handshake await; on expiry raise `CHANNEL_OPEN_FAILED` (61).

**Phase 6 — restart_epoch hook (coupled to #10).**
10. Write `restart_epoch=0` at create; leave the increment-on-A-T8 hook for #10 (do **not** reset `status`/`sequence_high` on restart — that is INV-CH5).

### Tests / verification

- `seq1_deploy.rs`: assert `channels` has command + telemetry + artifact rows `open` for the binding (today: zero).
- New `seq4_recovery.rs` case: kill transport → re-probe → `failed` + B-T7.
- §2.10.6 joint test (with #10): channel survives A-T8, sequence continues, `restart_epoch` increments.
- **Live:** re-run the SEQ-1 deploy from `../../v0.1-integration.md §2` and confirm `SELECT count(*) FROM channels WHERE binding_id=…` > 0 (was 0 with 3 live channels).

### Risk & sequencing

overseer + gateway, `[runtime]` — B-T3/T-T3 become gated on channel state, so **land Phase 1 (rows, observational) before Phase 2 (gates)** to avoid regressing deploy on a channel-open race. DB layer is unchanged (no migration). Phases 3–5 are independent and can land in any order after Phase 1.

## Execution log

**2026-06-16 — Batch #1–#8 (spec-first + config tier) landed.** 7 Done · 1 Spec✓.

- **#1 `schema-beta.md`** ✓ — marked `bindings.agent_id` nullable (BYO-infra note) and added `bindings.container_id`, `agents.prior_status`, `tasks.paused_at`, and `artifacts_emitted_at_idx` (each cites its impl migration). The Atlas DDL now matches the live `overseer-db`.
- **#2 `proto-catalog-beta.md`** ✓ — added the `TerminalEvent` message + `Envelope.payload` tag 32; recorded the `skills` enum-vs-string divergence (resolution tracked as #21); annotated dormant `TASK_CANCEL`.
- **#3 Run/Query** — **Spec✓** (code half pending). Added a Taxonomy-reconciliation note to `overseer-beta.md §1.4` (Run/Query are *not* System Operations — retained only as availability shorthand). Removing `SystemOperation::Run`/`Query` from `atelier-overseer` remains as the code half.
- **#4 `fsm-beta.md §2.4`** ✓ — annotated the deferred Experiment-FSM sketch as non-normative and superseded by C6 (overdex-owned, no Atlas FSM).
- **#5 `provision-kafka-topics.sh`** ✓ — `control.manifests` now created with `cleanup.policy=compact`; fixed the stale `reconfigure` comment + a path typo. `bash -n` clean.
- **#6 `KAFKA_GROUP_ID`** ✓ — default `atelier-backend → atelier-overseer` in `config.rs`, `docker-compose.beta.yml`, `atelier-k8s/overseer/deployment.yaml`, and the crate README. *(Out of scope, noted: the README per-topic group examples and `docs/m3-boot-manual.md` still say `atelier-backend` — stale historical docs.)*
- **#7 gateway port** ✓ — SDK `gateway_url` default `50051 → 50443` (`gateway.rs` ×3 + the `orchestrator.rs` defaults test) and the overseer root README. The overseer's own `GATEWAY_URL` default was already `50443`.
- **#8 hygiene** ✓ — fixed the two wrong lakehouse README engine labels (`overledger-db` = PostgreSQL; `overplex-db` = ClickHouse). **Correction to the finding:** `/api/workers` no longer exists in the overseer, and `AgentManager` is the **live PlatformAgent DockerSpawner** (wired into every integration test) — correctly **retained**, not removed. The orphaned `atelier-overseer/model-artifacts/` dir (13 stale `hawkes_fit_*.json`, ~750 KB) is **flagged for manual removal** — pre-existing data not created in this session; suggest `rm -rf atelier-overseer/model-artifacts` + a `.gitignore` entry.

**Verification:** all edits grep-confirmed; the provisioner passes `bash -n`. Rust edits are string-literal defaults only (no compile risk) — run `cargo check -p atelier-overseer` / `-p atelier-connect` at your convenience. No live stack required (Docker is wiped).

**2026-06-16 — #9 (Channel wiring) Phase 1 landed → `Doing`.** Pure caller-wiring; **no proto/wire change** (the `ChannelOpening`/`ChannelOpen` Event variants, tags 90/91, and their handler name-map already existed). Scoped via a 6-agent recon workflow.

- Wired the dead `channels.rs` primitives into `Scheduler::complete_bind` (`scheduler.rs`): on **first connect, after B-T3**, it now creates + opens durable rows for all **5 logical channels** (command/manifest/telemetry/data/artifact) — **CH-T1 → CH-T2** — and emits `ChannelOpening`/`ChannelOpen`. Best-effort (`match`, no `?`) so a channel-row failure cannot regress the deploy; placed **below the pending-only idempotency guard** so duplicate at-least-once `connected` events don't double-create; `manifest` uses a fresh `idempotency_key` (avoids the `channels_idempotency_key_uniq` collision).
- **Deliberately did NOT** create channels in `resume_drained_bind` (INV-CH5: gateway-persistent channels survive A-T8 and must not cycle) — marked with a comment; reconnect de-dup is Phase 3/4.
- Updated the B-T3 doc-comment in `transitions.rs` (was "Channel state is in-memory / deferred table").
- **Hardened over the drafted code:** the channel-spec array is **explicitly typed** (`[(&str,&str,&str,Option<Uuid>,Option<Uuid>); 5]`) so the all-`None` `sink_id` column can't break type inference.
- **Verification:** grep-confirmed (callers now exist; were zero). **You run `cargo check -p atelier-overseer`.** Live check after a re-deployed SEQ-1: `SELECT category,status,opened_at IS NOT NULL FROM channels WHERE binding_id=…` → expect 5 rows, all `open` (was 0 with live channels).
- **Remaining for #9 → Done (Phases 2–6):** the B-T3/T-T3 gates (IR-CHO1/CHO3), recovery re-probe (IR-CHO4), drain (CH-T3/T4), gateway timers, and per-Sink ArtifactChannel + real manifest idempotency key. **Wire-change note:** terminal Channel events (`ChannelDraining`/`Closed`/`Failed`) are **not yet in the proto** — broadcasting those in Phase 2+ needs a wire change (DB-only landing does not).

**Next:** after your `cargo check`, finish **#9** (Phases 2–6) or start **#10** (restart_epoch) — both need a re-deployed stack only for final live verification.

**2026-06-16 — branch consolidation → `fix/txy-fsm-for-beta`.** All txy-fsm work consolidated onto a dedicated branch of that name across 5 repos: `atelier-overseer` (off `fix/qa-findings-f1-f5` = the dissolution+FSM-E1–E7 foundation, **not** the archived `main` monolith — which still bundles `atelier-payments` and won't compile), `atelier-infra`, `atelier-sdk`, `atelier-lakehouse` (README only; overplex migrations left to you), and `atelier-webdocs` (this `notes/` tree, newly version-controlled). Local only — not pushed; no co-author trailers.

*Maintenance: this is the durable reconciliation index — update **Status**/**Owner** in place as items land (use `Done`/strike-through) and re-rank the remainder. Findings evidence lives in `../../v0.1-integration.md`; the normative yardstick is `fsm/` + `txy/`; this file is linked from [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md). When #9 lands, expand #10 and #11 into sibling plan subsections.*
